OOo2GD is written in Java 6.
For MacOS only available Java 6 is 64 bit application.
OpenOffice.org on MacOS is 32 bit application.
32 bit application cannot use 64 bit application, so OOo2GD doesn't work on MacOS.

Currently I try to make Java 5 version of OOo2GD. I hope this version will have as much as possible of features from current OOo2GD.
