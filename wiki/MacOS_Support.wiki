#Help me with support for Mac OS

= Introduction =

From technical point of view OOo2GD should work everywhere where is present proper implementation of Java 6.
It works for sure everywhere where is Sun Java 6.
On MacOS users must use Apple Java instead of Sun Java, and here is a problem.
I'm searching for some good soul with MacOS with Java 6 and some free time, if you are programmer it will be wonderful and easier, but it is not required.


= Details =

If you want to help with support for MacOS: 
mail me on [http://przemelek.googlepages.com/przemelekMail.png/przemelekMail-full.jpg], you can use English or Polish.
After this I will try to produce special version of !AddOn which will create logs which should help me to find source of problem. I will send you this special version of !AddOn. Logs may help me determine what to change for support of MacOS.
