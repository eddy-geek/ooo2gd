From technical point of view OOo2GD should work everywhere where is present proper implementation of Java 6.
It works for sure everywhere where is Sun Java 6.
On MacOS users must use Apple Java instead of Sun Java, and here is a problem.
I'm searching for some good soul with MacOS with Java 6 and some free time, if you are programmer it will be wonderful and easier, but it is not required.
